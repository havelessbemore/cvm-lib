  mar holla bernardo
  ber say
    what is horatio there 
  hor a piece of him
  ber welcome horatio welcome good marcellus
  mar what has this thing appeard again tonight
  ber i have seen nothing
  mar horatio says tis but our fantasy
    and will not let belief take hold of him
    touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
    therefore i have entreated him along  
    with us to watch the minutes of this night
    that if again this apparition come
    he may approve our eyes and speak to it
  hor tush tush twill not appear
  ber sit down awhile
    and let us once again assail your ears
    that are so fortified against our story
    what we two nights have seen
  hor well sit we down
    and let us hear bernardo speak of this
  ber last night of all
    when yond same star thats westward from the pole
    had made his course t illume that part of heaven
    where now it burns marcellus and myself
    the bell then beating one

                        enter ghost

  mar peace break thee off look where it comes again
  ber in the same figure like the king thats dead  
  mar thou art a scholar speak to it horatio
  ber looks it not like the king mark it horatio
  hor most like it harrows me with fear and wonder
  ber it would be spoke to
  mar question it horatio
  hor what art thou that usurpst this time of night
    together with that fair and warlike form
    in which the majesty of buried denmark
    did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak
  mar it is offended
  ber see it stalks away
  hor stay speak speak i charge thee speak
                                                     exit ghost
  mar tis gone and will not answer
  ber how now horatio you tremble and look pale
    is not this something more than fantasy
    what think you ont
  hor before my god i might not this believe
    without the sensible and true avouch
    of mine own eyes  
  mar is it not like the king
  hor as thou art to thyself
    such was the very armour he had on
    when he th ambitious norway combated
    so frownd he once when in an angry parle
    he smote the sledded polacks on the ice
    tis strange
  mar thus twice before and jump at this dead hour
    with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
  hor in what particular thought to work i know not
    but in the gross and scope of my opinion
    this bodes some strange eruption to our state
  mar good now sit down and tell me he that knows
    why this same strict and most observant watch
    so nightly toils the subject of the land
    and why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    and foreign mart for implements of war
    why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
    does not divide the sunday from the week
    what might be toward that this sweaty haste  
    doth make the night jointlabourer with the day
    who ist that can inform me
  hor that can i
    at least the whisper goes so our last king
    whose image even but now appeard to us
    was as you know by fortinbras of norway
    thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride
    dard to the combat in which our valiant hamlet
    for so this side of our known world esteemd him
    did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact
    well ratified by law and heraldry
    did forfeit with his life all those his lands
    which he stood seizd of to the conqueror
    against the which a moiety competent
    was gaged by our king which had returnd
    to the inheritance of fortinbras
    had he been vanquisher as by the same comart
    and carriage of the article designd
    his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras
    of unimproved mettle hot and full  
    hath in the skirts of norway here and there
    sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes
    for food and diet to some enterprise
    that hath a stomach int which is no other
    as it doth well appear unto our state
    but to recover of us by strong hand
    and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands
    so by his father lost and this i take it
    is the main motive of our preparations
    the source of this our watch and the chief head
    of this posthaste and romage in the land
  ber i think it be no other but een so
    well may it sort that this portentous figure
    comes armed through our watch so like the king
    that was and is the question of these wars
  hor a mote it is to trouble the minds eye
    in the most high and palmy state of rome
    a little ere the mightiest julius fell
    the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
    did squeak and gibber in the roman streets  
    as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
    disasters in the sun and the moist star
    upon whose influence neptunes empire stands
    was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
    and even the like precurse of fierce events
    as harbingers preceding still the fates
    and prologue to the omen coming on
    have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    unto our climature and countrymen

                      enter ghost again

    but soft behold lo where it comes again
    ill cross it though it blast me stay illusion
                                               spreads his arms
    if thou hast any sound or use of voice
    speak to me
    if there be any good thing to be done
    that may to thee do ease and race to me
    speak to me  
    if thou art privy to thy countrys fate
    which happily foreknowing may avoid
    o speak
    or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    for which they say you spirits oft walk in death
                                                 the cock crows
    speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus
  mar shall i strike at it with my partisan
  hor do if it will not stand
  ber tis here
  hor tis here
  mar tis gone
                                                     exit ghost
    we do it wrong being so majestical
    to offer it the show of violence
    for it is as the air invulnerable
    and our vain blows malicious mockery
  ber it was about to speak when the cock crew
  hor and then it started like a guilty thing  
    upon a fearful summons i have heard
    the cock that is the trumpet to the morn
    doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat
    awake the god of day and at his warning
    whether in sea or fire in earth or air
    th extravagant and erring spirit hies
    to his confine and of the truth herein
    this present object made probation
  mar it faded on the crowing of the cock
    some say that ever gainst that season comes
    wherein our saviours birth is celebrated
    the bird of dawning singeth all night long
    and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad
    the nights are wholesome then no planets strike
    no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
    so hallowd and so gracious is the time
  hor so have i heard and do in part believe it
    but look the morn in russet mantle clad
    walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill
    break we our watch up and by my advice  
    let us impart what we have seen tonight
    unto young hamlet for upon my life
    this spirit dumb to us will speak to him
    do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
    as needful in our loves fitting our duty
    lets dot i pray and i this morning know
    where we shall find him most conveniently           exeunt

scene ii
elsinore a room of state in the castle

flourish enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet
polonius laertes and his sister ophelia voltemand cornelius
lords attendant

  king though yet of hamlet our dear brothers death
    the memory be green and that it us befitted
    to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
    to be contracted in one brow of woe
    yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    that we with wisest sorrow think on him
    together with remembrance of ourselves
    therefore our sometime sister now our queen
    th imperial jointress to this warlike state
    have we as twere with a defeated joy
    with an auspicious and a dropping eye
    with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
    in equal scale weighing delight and dole
    taken to wife nor have we herein barrd
    your better wisdoms which have freely gone  
    with this affair along for all our thanks
    now follows that you know young fortinbras
    holding a weak supposal of our worth
    or thinking by our late dear brothers death
    our state to be disjoint and out of frame
    colleagued with this dream of his advantage
    he hath not faild to pester us with message
    importing the surrender of those lands
    lost by his father with all bands of law
    to our most valiant brother so much for him
    now for ourself and for this time of meeting
    thus much the business is we have here writ
    to norway uncle of young fortinbras
    who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears
    of this his nephews purpose to suppress
    his further gait herein in that the levies
    the lists and full proportions are all made
    out of his subject and we here dispatch
    you good cornelius and you voltemand
    for bearers of this greeting to old norway  
    giving to you no further personal power
    to business with the king more than the scope
    of these dilated articles allow            gives a paper
    farewell and let your haste commend your duty
  cor volt in that and all things will we show our duty
  king we doubt it nothing heartily farewell
                                 exeunt voltemand and cornelius
    and now laertes whats the news with you
    you told us of some suit what ist laertes
    you cannot speak of reason to the dane
    and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes
    that shall not be my offer not thy asking
    the head is not more native to the heart
    the hand more instrumental to the mouth
    than is the throne of denmark to thy father
    what wouldst thou have laertes
  laer my dread lord
    your leave and favour to return to france
    from whence though willingly i came to denmark
    to show my duty in your coronation  
    yet now i must confess that duty done
    my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france
    and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
  king have you your fathers leave what says polonius
  pol he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
    by laboursome petition and at last
    upon his will i seald my hard consent
    i do beseech you give him leave to go
  king take thy fair hour laertes time be thine
    and thy best graces spend it at thy will
    but now my cousin hamlet and my son
  ham aside a little more than kin and less than kind
  king how is it that the clouds still hang on you
  ham not so my lord i am too much i th sun
  queen good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
    and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark
    do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    seek for thy noble father in the dust
    thou knowst tis common all that lives must die
    passing through nature to eternity  
  ham ay madam it is common
  queen if it be
    why seems it so particular with thee
  ham seems madam nay it is i know not seems
    tis not alone my inky cloak good mother
    nor customary suits of solemn black
    nor windy suspiration of forcd breath
    no nor the fruitful river in the eye
    nor the dejected havior of the visage
    together with all forms moods shapes of grief
    that can denote me truly these indeed seem
    for they are actions that a man might play
    but i have that within which passeth show
    these but the trappings and the suits of woe
  king tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet
    to give these mourning duties to your father
    but you must know your father lost a father
    that father lost lost his and the survivor bound
    in filial obligation for some term
    to do obsequious sorrow but to persever  
    in obstinate condolement is a course
    of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief
    it shows a will most incorrect to heaven
    a heart unfortified a mind impatient
    an understanding simple and unschoold
    for what we know must be and is as common
    as any the most vulgar thing to sense
    why should we in our peevish opposition
    take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven
    a fault against the dead a fault to nature
    to reason most absurd whose common theme
    is death of fathers and who still hath cried
    from the first corse till he that died today
    this must be so we pray you throw to earth
    this unprevailing woe and think of us
    as of a father for let the world take note
    you are the most immediate to our throne
    and with no less nobility of love
    than that which dearest father bears his son
    do i impart toward you for your intent  
    in going back to school in wittenberg
    it is most retrograde to our desire
    and we beseech you bend you to remain
    here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
    our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
  queen let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet
    i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg
  ham i shall in all my best obey you madam
  king why tis a loving and a fair reply
    be as ourself in denmark madam come
    this gentle and unforcd accord of hamlet
    sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
    no jocund health that denmark drinks today
    but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
    and the kings rouse the heaven shall bruit again
    respeaking earthly thunder come away
                                flourish exeunt all but hamlet
  ham o that this too too solid flesh would melt
    thaw and resolve itself into a dew
    or that the everlasting had not fixd  
    his canon gainst selfslaughter o god god
    how weary stale flat and unprofitable
    seem to me all the uses of this world
    fie ont ah fie tis an unweeded garden
    that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
    possess it merely that it should come to this
    but two months dead nay not so much not two
    so excellent a king that was to this
    hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
    that he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    visit her face too roughly heaven and earth
    must i remember why she would hang on him
    as if increase of appetite had grown
    by what it fed on and yet within a month
    let me not think ont frailty thy name is woman
    a little month or ere those shoes were old
    with which she followed my poor fathers body
    like niobe all tears why she even she
    o god a beast that wants discourse of reason
    would have mournd longer married with my uncle  
    my fathers brother but no more like my father
    than i to hercules within a month
    ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    had left the flushing in her galled eyes
    she married o most wicked speed to post
    with such dexterity to incestuous sheets
    it is not nor it cannot come to good
    but break my heart for i must hold my tongue

          enter horatio marcellus and bernardo

  hor hail to your lordship
  ham i am glad to see you well
    horatio or i do forget myself
  hor the same my lord and your poor servant ever

    but what in faith make you from wittenberg
  hor a truant disposition good my lord
  ham i would not hear your enemy say so
    nor shall you do my ear that violence
    to make it truster of your own report
    against yourself i know you are no truant
    but what is your affair in elsinore
    well teach you to drink deep ere you depart
  hor my lord i came to see your fathers funeral
  ham i prithee do not mock me fellow student
    i think it was to see my mothers wedding
  hor indeed my lord it followed hard upon
  ham thrift thrift horatio the funeral bakd meats
    did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
    would i had met my dearest foe in heaven
    or ever i had seen that day horatio
    my father methinks i see my father
  hor o where my lord
  ham in my minds eye horatio
  hor i saw him once he was a goodly king  
  ham he was a man take him for all in all

  hor season your admiration for a while
    with an attent ear till i may deliver
    upon the witness of these gentlemen
    this marvel to you
  ham for gods love let me hear
  hor two nights together had these gentlemen
    marcellus and bernardo on their watch
    in the dead vast and middle of the night
    been thus encountred a figure like your father
    armed at point exactly capape
    appears before them and with solemn march
    goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd
    by their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes
    within his truncheons length whilst they distilld  
    almost to jelly with the act of fear
    stand dumb and speak not to him this to me
    in dreadful secrecy impart they did
    and i with them the third night kept the watch
    where as they had deliverd both in time
    form of the thing each word made true and good
    the apparition comes i knew your father
    these hands are not more like
  ham but where was this
  mar my lord upon the platform where we watchd
  ham did you not speak to it
  hor my lord i did
    but answer made it none yet once methought
    it lifted up it head and did address
    itself to motion like as it would speak
    but even then the morning cock crew loud
    and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    and vanishd from our sight
  ham tis very strange
  hor as i do live my honourd lord tis true  
    and we did think it writ down in our duty
    to let you know of it
  ham indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
    hold you the watch tonight
  both mar and ber we do my lord
  ham armd say you
  both armd my lord
  ham from top to toe
  both my lord from head to foot
  ham then saw you not his face
  hor o yes my lord he wore his beaver up
  ham what lookd he frowningly
  hor a countenance more in sorrow than in anger
  ham pale or red
  hor nay very pale
  ham and fixd his eyes upon you
  hor most constantly
  ham i would i had been there
  hor it would have much amazd you
  ham very like very like stayd it long  
  hor while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
  both longer longer
  hor not when i sawt
  ham his beard was grizzled no
  hor it was as i have seen it in his life
    a sable silverd
  ham i will watch tonight
    perchance twill walk again
  hor i warrnt it will
  ham if it assume my noble fathers person
    ill speak to it though hell itself should gape
    and bid me hold my peace i pray you all
    if you have hitherto conceald this sight
    let it be tenable in your silence still
    and whatsoever else shall hap tonight
    give it an understanding but no tongue
    i will requite your loves so fare you well
    upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve
    ill visit you
  all our duty to your honour  
  ham your loves as mine to you farewell
                                        exeunt all but hamlet
    my fathers spirit in arms all is not well
    i doubt some foul play would the night were come
    till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise
    though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes
exit

scene iii
elsinore a room in the house of polonius

enter laertes and ophelia

  laer my necessaries are embarkd farewell
    and sister as the winds give benefit
    and convoy is assistant do not sleep
    but let me hear from you
  oph do you doubt that
  laer for hamlet and the trifling of his favour
    hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
    a violet in the youth of primy nature
    forward not permanent sweet not lasting
    the perfume and suppliance of a minute
    no more
  oph no more but so
  laer think it no more
    for nature crescent does not grow alone
    in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
    the inward service of the mind and soul
    grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now  
    and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    the virtue of his will but you must fear
    his greatness weighd his will is not his own
    for he himself is subject to his birth
    he may not as unvalued persons do
    carve for himself for on his choice depends
    the safety and health of this whole state
    and therefore must his choice be circumscribd
    unto the voice and yielding of that body
    whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you
    it fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    as he in his particular act and place
    may give his saying deed which is no further
    than the main voice of denmark goes withal
    then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    if with too credent ear you list his songs
    or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
    to his unmastred importunity
    fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister
    and keep you in the rear of your affection  
    out of the shot and danger of desire
    the chariest maid is prodigal enough
    if she unmask her beauty to the moon
    virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes
    the canker galls the infants of the spring
    too oft before their buttons be disclosd
    and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    contagious blastments are most imminent
    be wary then best safety lies in fear
    youth to itself rebels though none else near
  oph i shall th effect of this good lesson keep
    as watchman to my heart but good my brother
    do not as some ungracious pastors do
    show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
    whiles like a puffd and reckless libertine
    himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    and recks not his own rede
  laer o fear me not

                       enter polonius  

    i stay too long but here my father comes
    a double blessing is a double grace
    occasion smiles upon a second leave
  pol yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame
    the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
    and you are stayd for there my blessing with thee
    and these few precepts in thy memory
    look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue
    nor any unproportiond thought his act
    be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
    those friends thou hast and their adoption tried
    grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel
    but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    of each newhatchd unfledgd comrade beware
    of entrance to a quarrel but being in
    beart that th opposed may beware of thee
    give every man thine ear but few thy voice
    take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment
    costly thy habit as thy purse can buy  
    but not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy
    for the apparel oft proclaims the man
    and they in france of the best rank and station
    are most select and generous chief in that
    neither a borrower nor a lender be
    for loan oft loses both itself and friend
    and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
    this above all to thine own self be true
    and it must follow as the night the day
    thou canst not then be false to any man
    farewell my blessing season this in thee
  laer most humbly do i take my leave my lord
  pol the time invites you go your servants tend
  laer farewell ophelia and remember well
    what i have said to you
  oph tis in my memory lockd
    and you yourself shall keep the key of it
  laer farewell                                          exit
  pol what ist ophelia he hath said to you
  oph so please you something touching the lord hamlet  
  pol marry well bethought
    tis told me he hath very oft of late
    given private time to you and you yourself
    have of your audience been most free and bounteous
    if it be so as so tis put on me
    and that in way of caution i must tell you
    you do not understand yourself so clearly
    as it behooves my daughter and your honour
    what is between you give me up the truth
  oph he hath my lord of late made many tenders
    of his affection to me
  pol affection pooh you speak like a green girl

  pol marry i will teach you think yourself a baby
    that you have taen these tenders for true pay
    which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly

    with almost all the holy vows of heaven
  pol ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know
    when the blood burns how prodigal the soul
    lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter
    giving more light than heat extinct in both
    even in their promise as it is amaking
    you must not take for fire from this time
    be something scanter of your maiden presence
    set your entreatments at a higher rate
    than a command to parley for lord hamlet
    believe so much in him that he is young
    and with a larger tether may he walk
    than may be given you in few ophelia
    do not believe his vows for they are brokers
    not of that dye which their investments show
    but mere implorators of unholy suits  
    breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
    the better to beguile this is for all
    i would not in plain terms from this time forth
    have you so slander any moment leisure
    as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet
    look tot i charge you come your ways

  ham the air bites shrewdly it is very cold
  hor it is a nipping and an eager air
  ham what hour now
  hor i think it lacks of twelve
  mar no it is struck
  hor indeed i heard it not it then draws near the season
    wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
                   a flourish of trumpets and two pieces go off
    what does this mean my lord
  ham the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse
    keeps wassail and the swaggring upspring reels
    and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down
    the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    the triumph of his pledge
  hor is it a custom
  ham ay marry ist
    but to my mind though i am native here  
    and to the manner born it is a custom
    more honourd in the breach than the observance
    this heavyheaded revel east and west
    makes us traducd and taxd of other nations
    they clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    soil our addition and indeed it takes
    from our achievements though performd at height
    the pith and marrow of our attribute
    so oft it chances in particular men
    that for some vicious mole of nature in them
    as in their birth wherein they are not guilty
    since nature cannot choose his origin
    by the oergrowth of some complexion
    oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
    or by some habit that too much oerleavens
    the form of plausive manners that these men
    carrying i say the stamp of one defect
    being natures livery or fortunes star
    their virtues else be they as pure as grace
    as infinite as man may undergo  
    shall in the general censure take corruption
    from that particular fault the dram of eil
    doth all the noble substance often dout to his own scandal

    why thy canonizd bones hearsed in death
    have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
    wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd
    hath opd his ponderous and marble jaws
    to cast thee up again what may this mean  
    that thou dead corse again in complete steel
    revisits thus the glimpses of the moon
    making night hideous and we fools of nature
    so horridly to shake our disposition
    with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
    say why is this wherefore what should we do

  hor no by no means
  ham it will not speak then will i follow it
  hor do not my lord

    i do not set my life at a pins fee
    and for my soul what can it do to that
    being a thing immortal as itself  
    it waves me forth again ill follow it
  hor what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
    or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    that beetles oer his base into the sea
    and there assume some other horrible form
    which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    and draw you into madness think of it
    the very place puts toys of desperation
    without more motive into every brain
    that looks so many fadoms to the sea
    and hears it roar beneath
  ham it waves me still
    go on ill follow thee
  mar you shall not go my lord
  ham hold off your hands
  hor be ruld you shall not go

    to tell the secrets of my prison house
    i could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
    make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
    thy knotted and combined locks to part
    and each particular hair to stand an end
    like quills upon the fretful porpentine

    o hamlet what a fallingoff was there
    from me whose love was of that dignity
    that it went hand in hand even with the vow
    i made to her in marriage and to decline
    upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
    to those of mine
    but virtue as it never will be movd
    though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
    so lust though to a radiant angel linkd
    will sate itself in a celestial bed
    and prey on garbage
    but soft methinks i scent the morning air
    brief let me be sleeping within my orchard
    my custom always of the afternoon
    upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
    with juice of cursed hebona in a vial
    and in the porches of my ears did pour
    the leperous distilment whose effect
    holds such an enmity with blood of man
    that swift as quicksilverr it courses through
    the natural gates and alleys of the body
    and with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    and curd like eager droppings into milk
    the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine
    and a most instant tetter barkd about  
    most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust
    all my smooth body
    thus was i sleeping by a brothers hand
    of life of crown of queen at once dispatchd
    cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
    unhousled disappointed unaneld
    no reckoning made but sent to my account
    with all my imperfections on my head
  ham o horrible o horrible most horrible
  ghost if thou hast nature in thee bear it not
    let not the royal bed of denmark be
    a couch for luxury and damned incest
    but howsoever thou pursuest this act
    taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
    against thy mother aught leave her to heaven
    and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    to prick and sting her fare thee well at once

  pol with what i th name of god i
  oph my lord as i was sewing in my closet
    lord hamlet with his doublet all unbracd
    no hat upon his head his stockings fould
    ungartred and downgyved to his ankle
    pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
    and with a look so piteous in purport
    as if he had been loosed out of hell
    to speak of horrors he comes before me
  pol mad for thy love  
  oph my lord i do not know
    but truly i do fear it
  pol what said he
  oph he took me by the wrist and held me hard
    then goes he to the length of all his arm
    and with his other hand thus oer his brow
    he falls to such perusal of my face
    as he would draw it long stayd he so
    at last a little shaking of mine arm
    and thrice his head thus waving up and down
    he raisd a sigh so piteous and profound
    as it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    and end his being that done he lets me go
    and with his head over his shoulder turnd
    he seemd to find his way without his eyes
    for out o doors he went without their help
    and to the last bended their light on me
  pol come go with me i will go seek the king
    this is the very ecstasy of love
    whose violent property fordoes itself  
    and leads the will to desperate undertakings
    as oft as any passion under heaven
    that does afflict our natures i am sorry
    what have you given him any hard words of late
  oph no my good lord but as you did command
    i did repel his letters and denied
    his access to me
  pol that hath made him mad
    i am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    i had not quoted him i feard he did but trifle
    and meant to wrack thee but beshrew my jealousy
    by heaven it is as proper to our age
    to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    as it is common for the younger sort
    to lack discretion come go we to the king
    this must be known which being kept close might move
    more grief to hide than hate to utter love

    and since so neighbourd to his youth and haviour
    that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    some little time so by your companies

    i will be brief your noble son is mad
    mad call i it for to define true madness
    what ist but to be nothing else but mad
    but let that go
  queen more matter with less art
  pol madam i swear i use no art at all
    that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity
    and pity tis tis true a foolish figure
    but farewell it for i will use no art  
    mad let us grant him then and now remains
    that we find out the cause of this effect
    or rather say the cause of this defect
    for this effect defective comes by cause
    thus it remains and the remainder thus

    i have a daughter have while she is mine
    who in her duty and obedience mark
    hath given me this now gather and surmise
                                             reads the letter
    to the celestial and my souls idol the most beautified
      ophelia

    thats an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile
      phrase
    but you shall hear thus
                                                        reads
    in her excellent white bosom these c
  queen came this from hamlet to her
  pol good madam stay awhile i will be faithful     reads  

          doubt thou the stars are fire
            doubt that the sun doth move
          doubt truth to be a liar
            but never doubt i love
      o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers i have not art to
    reckon my groans but that i love thee best o most best believe
    it adieu
      thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him
                                                          hamlet

    this in obedience hath my daughter shown me
    and more above hath his solicitings
    as they fell out by time by means and place
    all given to mine ear
  king but how hath she
    receivd his love
  pol what do you think of me
  king as of a man faithful and honourable
  pol i would fain prove so but what might you think  
    when i had seen this hot love on the wing
    as i perceivd it i must tell you that
    before my daughter told me what might you
    or my dear majesty your queen here think
    if i had playd the desk or table book
    or given my heart a winking mute and dumb
    or lookd upon this love with idle sight
    what might you think no i went round to work
    and my young mistress thus i did bespeak
    lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star
    this must not be and then i prescripts gave her
    that she should lock herself from his resort
    admit no messengers receive no tokens
    which done she took the fruits of my advice
    and he repulsed a short tale to make
    fell into a sadness then into a fast
    thence to a watch thence into a weakness
    thence to a lightness and by this declension
    into the madness wherein now he raves
    and all we mourn for  
  king do you think tis this
  queen it may be very like
  pol hath there been such a time i would fain know that
    that i have positively said tis so
    when it provd otherwise
  king not that i know
  pol points to his head and shoulder take this from this if this
      be otherwise
    if circumstances lead me i will find
    where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
    within the centre
  king how may we try it further
  pol you know sometimes he walks four hours together
    here in the lobby
  queen so he does indeed
  pol at such a time ill loose my daughter to him
    be you and i behind an arras then
    mark the encounter if he love her not
    and he not from his reason falln thereon
    let me be no assistant for a state  
    but keep a farm and carters
  king we will try it

                 enter hamlet reading on a book

  pol aside though this be madness yet there is a method int
   will you walk out of the air my lord
  ham into my grave

    his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i

    him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take
    my leave of you

    strumpet what news 
  ros none my lord but that the worlds grown honest
  ham then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me
    question more in particular what have you my good friends
    deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither
  guil prison my lord  
  ham denmarks a prison
  ros then is the world one
  ham a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and
    dungeons denmark being one o th worst
  ros we think not so my lord
  ham why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good
    or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison
  ros why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your
    mind
  ham o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams
  guil which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
  ham a dream itself is but a shadow
  ros truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
    it is but a shadows shadow
  ham then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretchd
    heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my
    fay i cannot reason
  both well wait upon you

    visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak
  guil what should we say my lord
  ham why anything but to th purpose you were sent for and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties
    have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen
    have sent for you
  ros to what end my lord
  ham that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights
    of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the
    obligation of our everpreserved love and by what more dear a
    better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with
    me whether you were sent for or no  
  ros aside to guildenstern what say you
  ham aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold
    not off
  guil my lord we were sent for
  ham i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
    feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my
    mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth
    seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the
    air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth no other thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a
    piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in
    faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in
    action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the
    beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what
    is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman
    neither though by your smiling you seem to say so
  ros my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts  
  ham why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me
  ros to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them
    on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service
  ham he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall
    have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
    target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall
    end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o th sere and the lady shall say her mind
    freely or the blank verse shall halt fort what players are
    they
  ros even those you were wont to take such delight in the
    tragedians of the city
  ham how chances it they travel their residence both in
    reputation and profit was better both ways
  ros i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation
  ham do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the
    city are they so followd
  ros no indeed are they not  
  ham how comes it do they grow rusty
  ros nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is
    sir an eyrie of children little eyases that cry out on the top
    of question and are most tyrannically clappd fort these are now
    the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call
    them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither
  ham what are they children who maintains em how are they
    escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow
    themselves to common players as it is most like if their means
    are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
    against their own succession
  ros faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a
    while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
    went to cuffs in the question
  ham ist possible
  guil o there has been much throwing about of brains
  ham do the boys carry it away  
  ros ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too
  ham it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
    little sblood there is something in this more than natural if
    philosophy could find it out

  guil there are the players
  ham gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come th
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply

  what speech my good lord
  ham i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted
    or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleasd  
    not the million twas caviary to the general but it was as i
    receivd it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in
    the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes
    set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation but calld it an honest method as wholesome as
    sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech int
    i chiefly lovd twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it
    especially where he speaks of priams slaughter if it live in
    your memory begin at this line let me see let me see

         the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast

    tis not so it begins with pyrrhus

         the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms
         black as his purpose did the night resemble
         when he lay couched in the ominous horse
         hath now this dread and black complexion smeard  
         with heraldry more dismal head to foot
         now is be total gules horridly trickd
         with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
         bakd and impasted with the parching streets
         that lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         to their lords murther roasted in wrath and fire
         and thus oersized with coagulate gore
         with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus
         old grandsire priam seeks

    so proceed you
  pol fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good
     discretion

  anon he finds him
      striking too short at greeks his antique sword
      rebellious to his arm lies where it falls
      repugnant to command unequal matchd
      pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide
      but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
      th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium
      seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
      stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
      takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword
      which was declining on the milky head
      of reverend priam seemd i th air to stick
      so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood
      and like a neutral to his will and matter
      did nothing
      but as we often see against some storm
      a silence in the heavens the rack stand still
      the bold winds speechless and the orb below
      as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
      doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause
      aroused vengeance sets him new awork
      and never did the cyclops hammers fall
      on marss armour forgd for proof eterne
      with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword
      now falls on priam
      out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods  
      in general synod take away her power
      break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
      and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
      as low as to the fiends

  pol this is too long
  ham it shall to the barbers with your beard prithee say on
    hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to
    hecuba

  but who o who had seen the mobled queen

  ham the mobled queen
  pol thats good mobled queen is good

  run barefoot up and down threatning the flames
      with bisson rheum a clout upon that head
      where late the diadem stood and for a robe
      about her lank and all oerteemed loins
      a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up  
      who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd
      gainst fortunes state would treason have pronouncd
      but if the gods themselves did see her then
      when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport
      in mincing with his sword her husbands limbs
      the instant burst of clamour that she made
      unless things mortal move them not at all
      would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      and passion in the gods

    now i am alone  
    o what a rogue and peasant slave am i
    is it not monstrous that this player here
    but in a fiction in a dream of passion
    could force his soul so to his own conceit
    that from her working all his visage wannd
    tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect
    a broken voice and his whole function suiting
    with forms to his conceit and all for nothing
    for hecuba
    whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba
    that he should weep for her what would he do
    had he the motive and the cue for passion
    that i have he would drown the stage with tears
    and cleave the general ear with horrid speech
    make mad the guilty and appal the free
    confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
    the very faculties of eyes and ears
    yet i
    a dull and muddymettled rascal peak
    like johnadreams unpregnant of my cause  
    and can say nothing no not for a king

    prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
    must like a whore unpack my heart with words
    and fall acursing like a very drab
    a scullion

    have by the very cunning of the scene
    been struck so to the soul that presently
    they have proclaimd their malefactions
    for murther though it have no tongue will speak
    with most miraculous organ ill have these players
    play something like the murther of my father
    before mine uncle ill observe his looks
    ill tent him to the quick if he but blench
    i know my course the spirit that i have seen
    may be a devil and the devil hath power

    out of my weakness and my melancholy

  king and can you by no drift of circumstance
    get from him why he puts on this confusion
    grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    with turbulent and dangerous lunacy
  ros he does confess he feels himself distracted
    but from what cause he will by no means speak
  guil nor do we find him forward to be sounded
    but with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    when we would bring him on to some confession
    of his true state
  queen did he receive you well
  ros most like a gentleman
  guil but with much forcing of his disposition
  ros niggard of question but of our demands
    most free in his reply
  queen did you assay him  
    to any pastime
  ros madam it so fell out that certain players
    we oerraught on the way of these we told him
    and there did seem in him a kind of joy
    to hear of it they are here about the court
    and as i think they have already order
    this night to play before him
  pol tis most true
    and he beseechd me to entreat your majesties
    to hear and see the matter
  king with all my heart and it doth much content me
    to hear him so inclind
    good gentlemen give him a further edge
    and drive his purpose on to these delights
  ros we shall my lord

  ham to be or not to be that is the question
    whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    or to take arms against a sea of troubles
    and by opposing end them to die to sleep
    no more and by a sleep to say we end
    the heartache and the thousand natural shocks
    that flesh is heir to tis a consummation  
    devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep
    to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub
    for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
    must give us pause theres the respect
    that makes calamity of so long life
    for who would bear the whips and scorns of time
    th oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely
    the pangs of despisd love the laws delay
    the insolence of office and the spurns
    that patient merit of th unworthy takes
    when he himself might his quietus make
    with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear
    to grunt and sweat under a weary life
    but that the dread of something after death
    the undiscoverd country from whose bourn
    no traveller returns puzzles the will
    and makes us rather bear those ills we have
    than fly to others that we know not of
    thus conscience does make cowards of us all  
    and thus the native hue of resolution
    is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought
    and enterprises of great pith and moment
    with this regard their currents turn awry
    and lose the name of action soft you now
    the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons
    be all my sins remembred
  oph good my lord
    how does your honour for this many a day

    that i have longed long to redeliver
    i pray you now receive them

  oph my honourd lord you know right well you did
    and with them words of so sweet breath composd

    there my lord
  ham ha ha are you honest
  oph my lord
  ham are you fair
  oph what means your lordship
  ham that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no
    discourse to your beauty
  oph could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty
  ham ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
    translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox
    but now the time gives it proof i did love you once
  oph indeed my lord you made me believe so
  ham you should not have believd me for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you
    not
  oph i was the more deceived
  ham get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me  
    i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my
    beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give
    them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i
    do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all
    believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery wheres your
    father
  oph at home my lord
  ham let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool
    nowhere but ins own house farewell
  oph o help him you sweet heavens
  ham if thou dost marry ill give thee this plague for thy dowry
    be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape
    calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt
    needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too
    farewell
  oph o heavenly powers restore him
  ham i have heard of your paintings too well enough god hath
    given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig you
    amble and you lisp you nickname gods creatures and make your  
    wantonness your ignorance go to ill no more ont it hath made

    sprung from neglected love how now ophelia
    you need not tell us what lord hamlet said
    we heard it all my lord do as you please

    and ill be placd so please you in the ear

  ham speak the speech i pray you as i pronouncd it to you
    trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of our
    players do i had as live the town crier spoke my lines nor do
    not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all
    gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say
    whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the
    soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to
    tatters to very rags to split the cars of the groundlings who
    for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
    shows and noise i would have such a fellow whippd for oerdoing
    termagant it outherods herod pray you avoid it
  player i warrant your honour
  ham be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your
    tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with
    this special observance that you oerstep not the modesty of
    nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing  
    whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as
    twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature
    scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his
    form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though
    it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious
    grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    oerweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i
    have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to
    speak it profanely that neither having the accent of
    christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so
    strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of natures
    journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated
    humanity so abominably
  player i hope we have reformd that indifferently with us sir
  ham o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them
    that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered thats villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go  
    make you ready

                      enter prologue

  ham we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel
    theyll tell all
  oph will he tell us what this show meant
  ham ay or any show that youll show him be not you ashamd to
    show hell not shame to tell you what it means
  oph you are naught you are naught ill mark the play

    pro for us and for our tragedy
      here stooping to your clemency
      we beg your hearing patiently                     exit

  ham is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
  oph tis brief my lord
  ham as womans love

              enter two players as king and queen  

    king full thirty times hath phoebus cart gone round
      neptunes salt wash and tellus orbed ground
      and thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
      about the world have times twelve thirties been
      since love our hearts and hymen did our hands
      unite comutual in most sacred bands
    queen so many journeys may the sun and moon
      make us again count oer ere love be done
      but woe is me you are so sick of late
      so far from cheer and from your former state
      that i distrust you yet though i distrust
      discomfort you my lord it nothing must
      for womens fear and love holds quantity
      in neither aught or in extremity
      now what my love is proof hath made you know
      and as my love is sizd my fear is so
      where love is great the littlest doubts are fear
      where little fears grow great great love grows there
    king faith i must leave thee love and shortly too  
      my operant powers their functions leave to do
      and thou shalt live in this fair world behind
      honourd belovd and haply one as kind
      for husband shalt thou
    queen o confound the rest
      such love must needs be treason in my breast
      when second husband let me be accurst
      none wed the second but who killed the first

  ham aside wormwood wormwood

    queen the instances that second marriage move
      are base respects of thrift but none of love
      a second time i kill my husband dead
      when second husband kisses me in bed
    king i do believe you think what now you speak
      but what we do determine oft we break
      purpose is but the slave to memory
      of violent birth but poor validity
      which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree  
      but fill unshaken when they mellow be
      most necessary tis that we forget
      to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
      what to ourselves in passion we propose
      the passion ending doth the purpose lose
      the violence of either grief or joy
      their own enactures with themselves destroy
      where joy most revels grief doth most lament
      grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
      this world is not for aye nor tis not strange
      that even our loves should with our fortunes change
      for tis a question left us yet to prove
      whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
      the great man down you mark his favourite flies
      the poor advancd makes friends of enemies
      and hitherto doth love on fortune tend
      for who not needs shall never lack a friend
      and who in want a hollow friend doth try
      directly seasons him his enemy
      but orderly to end where i begun  
      our wills and fates do so contrary run
      that our devices still are overthrown
      our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
      so think thou wilt no second husband wed
      but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
    queen nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
      sport and repose lock from me day and night
      to desperation turn my trust and hope
      an anchors cheer in prison be my scope
      each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      meet what i would have well and it destroy
      both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
      if once a widow ever i be wife

  ham if she should break it now

    king tis deeply sworn sweet leave me here awhile
      my spirits grow dull and fain i would beguile
      the tedious day with sleep
    queen sleep rock thy brain  
                                                    he sleeps
      and never come mischance between us twain

    to hear the process ill warrant shell tax him home
    and as you said and wisely was it said
    tis meet that some more audience than a mother

    o my offence is rank it smells to heaven
    it hath the primal eldest curse upont
    a brothers murther pray can i not
    though inclination be as sharp as will
    my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
    and like a man to double business bound
    i stand in pause where i shall first begin
    and both neglect what if this cursed hand
    were thicker than itself with brothers blood
    is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy
    but to confront the visage of offence
    and whats in prayer but this twofold force
    to be forestalled ere we come to fall  
    or pardond being down then ill look up
    my fault is past but o what form of prayer
    can serve my turn forgive me my foul murther
    that cannot be since i am still possessd
    of those effects for which i did the murther
    my crown mine own ambition and my queen
    may one be pardond and retain th offence
    in the corrupted currents of this world
    offences gilded hand may shove by justice
    and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself
    buys out the law but tis not so above
    there is no shuffling there the action lies
    in his true nature and we ourselves compelld
    even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
    to give in evidence what then what rests
    try what repentance can what can it not
    yet what can it when one cannot repent
    o wretched state o bosom black as death
    o limed soul that struggling to be free
    art more engagd help angels make assay  
    bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
    be soft as sinews of the newborn babe

    he took my father grossly full of bread
    with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may

    up sword and know thou a more horrid hent
    when he is drunk asleep or in his rage
    or in th incestuous pleasure of his bed
    at gaming swearing or about some act

    you are the queen your husbands brothers wife
    and would it were not so you are my mother
  queen nay then ill set those to you that can speak
  ham come come and sit you down you shall not budge i
    you go not till i set you up a glass
    where you may see the inmost part of you
  queen what wilt thou do thou wilt not murther me
    help help ho
  pol behind what ho help help help
  ham draws how now a rat dead for a ducat dead
            makes a pass through the arras and kills polonius
  pol behind o i am slain
  queen o me what hast thou done
  ham nay i know not is it the king
  queen o what a rash and bloody deed is this
  ham a bloody deed almost as bad good mother
    as kill a king and marry with his brother  
  queen as kill a king
  ham ay lady it was my word
                         lifts up the arras and sees polonius
    thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
    i took thee for thy better take thy fortune
    thou findst to be too busy is some danger
    leave wringing of your hinds peace sit you down
    and let me wring your heart for so i shall
    if it be made of penetrable stuff
    if damned custom have not brazd it so
    that it is proof and bulwark against sense
  queen what have i done that thou darst wag thy tongue
    in noise so rude against me
  ham such an act
    that blurs the grace and blush of modesty
    calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
    from the fair forehead of an innocent love
    and sets a blister there makes marriage vows
    as false as dicers oaths o such a deed
    as from the body of contraction plucks  
    the very soul and sweet religion makes
    a rhapsody of words heavens face doth glow
    yea this solidity and compound mass
    with tristful visage as against the doom
    is thoughtsick at the act
  queen ay me what act
    that roars so loud and thunders in the index
  ham look here upon ths picture and on this
    the counterfeit presentment of two brothers
    see what a grace was seated on this brow
    hyperions curls the front of jove himself
    an eye like mars to threaten and command
    a station like the herald mercury
    new lighted on a heavenkissing hill
    a combination and a form indeed
    where every god did seem to set his seal
    to give the world assurance of a man
    this was your husband look you now what follows
    here is your husband like a mildewd ear
    blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes  
    could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
    and batten on this moor ha have you eyes
    you cannot call it love for at your age
    the heyday in the blood is tame its humble
    and waits upon the judgment and what judgment
    would step from this to this sense sure you have
    else could you not have motion but sure that sense
    is apoplexd for madness would not err
    nor sense to ecstacy was neer so thralld
    but it reservd some quantity of choice
    to serve in such a difference what devil wast
    that thus hath cozend you at hoodmanblind
    eyes without feeling feeling without sight
    ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
    or but a sickly part of one true sense
    could not so mope
    o shame where is thy blush rebellious hell
    if thou canst mutine in a matrons bones
    to flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame  
    when the compulsive ardour gives the charge
    since frost itself as actively doth burn
    and reason panders will
  queen o hamlet speak no more
    thou turnst mine eyes into my very soul
    and there i see such black and grained spots
    as will not leave their tinct
  ham nay but to live
    in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
    stewd in corruption honeying and making love
    over the nasty sty
  queen o speak to me no more
    these words like daggers enter in mine ears
    no more sweet hamlet
  ham a murtherer and a villain
    a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    of your precedent lord a vice of kings
    a cutpurse of the empire and the rule
    that from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    and put it in his pocket  
  queen no more

                enter the ghost in his nightgown

  ham a king of shreds and patches
    save me and hover oer me with your wings
    you heavenly guards what would your gracious figure
  queen alas hes mad
  ham do you not come your tardy son to chide
    that lapsd in time and passion lets go by
    th important acting of your dread command
    o say
  ghost do not forget this visitation
    is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
    but look amazement on thy mother sits
    o step between her and her fighting soul
    conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
    speak to her hamlet
  ham how is it with you lady
  queen alas how ist with you  
    that you do bend your eye on vacancy
    and with th encorporal air do hold discourse
    forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
    and as the sleeping soldiers in th alarm
    your bedded hairs like life in excrements
    start up and stand an end o gentle son
    upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
    sprinkle cool patience whereon do you look
  ham on him on him look you how pale he glares
    his form and cause conjoind preaching to stones
    would make them capable do not look upon me
    lest with this piteous action you convert
    my stern effects then what i have to do
    will want true colour tears perchance for blood
  queen to whom do you speak this
  ham do you see nothing there
  queen nothing at all yet all that is i see
  ham nor did you nothing hear
  queen no nothing but ourselves
  ham why look you there look how it steals away  
    my father in his habit as he livd
    look where he goes even now out at the portal
                                                     exit ghost
  queen this is the very coinage of your brain
    this bodiless creation ecstasy

    my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    and makes as healthful music it is not madness
    that i have uttred bring me to the test
    and i the matter will reword which madness
    would gambol from mother for love of grace
    lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    that not your trespass but my madness speaks
    it will but skin and film the ulcerous place
    whiles rank corruption mining all within
    infects unseen confess yourself to heaven
    repent whats past avoid what is to come
    and do not spread the compost on the weeds
    to make them ranker forgive me this my virtue  
    for in the fatness of these pursy times
    virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
    yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
  queen o hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
  ham o throw away the worser part of it
    and live the purer with the other half
    good night but go not to my uncles bed
    assume a virtue if you have it not
    that monster custom who all sense doth eat
    of habits evil is angel yet in this
    that to the use of actions fair and good
    he likewise gives a frock or livery
    that aptly is put on refrain tonight
    and that shall lend a kind of easiness
    to the next abstinence the next more easy
    for use almost can change the stamp of nature
    and either master the devil or throw him out
    with wondrous potency once more good night
    and when you are desirous to be blest
    ill blessing beg of you for this same lord  
    i do repent but heaven hath pleasd it so
    to punish me with this and this with me
    that i must be their scourge and minister
    i will bestow him and will answer well
    the death i gave him so again good night
    i must be cruel only to be kind
    thus bad begins and worse remains behind
    one word more good lady
  queen what shall i do
  ham not this by no means that i bid you do
    let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
    pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
    and let him for a pair of reechy kisses
    or paddling in your neck with his damnd fingers
    make you to ravel all this matter out
    that i essentially am not in madness
    but mad in craft twere good you let him know
    for who thats but a queen fair sober wise
    would from a paddock from a bat a gib
    such dear concernings hide who would do so  
    no in despite of sense and secrecy
    unpeg the basket on the houses top
    let the birds fly and like the famous ape
    to try conclusions in the basket creep
    and break your own neck down
  queen be thou assurd if words be made of breath
    and breath of life i have no life to breathe
    what thou hast said to me
  ham i must to england you know that
  queen alack
    i had forgot tis so concluded on
  ham theres letters seald and my two schoolfellows
    whom i will trust as i will adders fangd
    they bear the mandate they must sweep my way
    and marshal me to knavery let it work
    for tis the sport to have the enginer
    hoist with his own petar and t shall go hard
    but i will delve one yard below their mines
    and blow them at the moon o tis most sweet
    when in one line two crafts directly meet  
    this man shall set me packing
    ill lug the guts into the neighbour room
    mother good night indeed this counsellor
    is now most still most secret and most grave

    yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    the hearers to collection they aim at it
    and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
    which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them
    indeed would make one think there might be thought

enter king and laertes

  king now must your conscience my acquittance seal
    and you must put me in your heart for friend
    sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
    that he which hath your noble father slain
    pursued my life
  laer it well appears but tell me
    why you proceeded not against these feats
    so crimeful and so capital in nature
    as by your safety wisdom all things else
    you mainly were stirrd up
  king o for two special reasons
    which may to you perhaps seein much unsinewd
    but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother
    lives almost by his looks and for myself
    my virtue or my plague be it either which
    shes so conjunctive to my life and soul
    that as the star moves not but in his sphere  
    i could not but by her the other motive
    why to a public count i might not go
    is the great love the general gender bear him
    who dipping all his faults in their affection
    would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
    convert his gives to graces so that my arrows
    too slightly timberd for so loud a wind
    would have reverted to my bow again
    and not where i had aimd them
  laer and so have i a noble father lost
    a sister driven into desprate terms
    whose worth if praises may go back again
    stood challenger on mount of all the age
    for her perfections but my revenge will come
  king break not your sleeps for that you must not think
    that we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    that we can let our beard be shook with danger
    and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more
    i lovd your father and we love ourself
    and that i hope will teach you to imagine

    occasion of my sudden and more strange return
                                                     hamlet
    what should this mean are all the rest come back
    or is it some abuse and no such thing  
  laer know you the hand
  king tis hamlets character naked
    and in a postscript here he says alone
    can you advise me
  laer i am lost in it my lord but let him come
    it warms the very sickness in my heart
    that i shall live and tell him to his teeth
    thus didest thou
  king if it be so laertes
    as how should it be so how otherwise
    will you be ruld by me
  laer ay my lord
    so you will not oerrule me to a peace
  king to thine own peace if he be now returnd
    as checking at his voyage and that he means
    no more to undertake it i will work him
    to exploit now ripe in my device
    under the which he shall not choose but fall
    and for his death no wind
    but even his mother shall uncharge the practice  
    and call it accident
  laer my lord i will be ruld
    the rather if you could devise it so
    that i might be the organ
  king it falls right
    you have been talkd of since your travel much
    and that in hamlets hearing for a quality
    wherein they say you shine your sun of parts
    did not together pluck such envy from him
    as did that one and that in my regard
    of the unworthiest siege
  laer what part is that my lord
  king a very riband in the cap of youth
    yet needfull too for youth no less becomes
    the light and careless livery that it wears
    thin settled age his sables and his weeds
    importing health and graveness two months since
    here was a gentleman of normandy
    i have seen myself and servd against the french
    and they can well on horseback but this gallant  
    had witchcraft int he grew unto his seat
    and to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    as had he been incorpsd and deminaturd
    with the brave beast so far he toppd my thought
    that i in forgery of shapes and tricks
    come short of what he did
  laer a norman wast
  king a norman
  laer upon my life lamound
  king the very same
  laer i know him well he is the broach indeed
    and gem of all the nation
  king he made confession of you
    and gave you such a masterly report
    for art and exercise in your defence
    and for your rapier most especially
    that he cried out twould be a sight indeed
    if one could match you the scrimers of their nation
    he swore had neither motion guard nor eye
    if you opposd them sir this report of his  
    did hamlet so envenom with his envy
    that he could nothing do but wish and beg
    your sudden coming oer to play with you
    now out of this
  laer what out of this my lord
  king laertes was your father dear to you
    or are you like the painting of a sorrow
    a face without a heart
  laer why ask you this
  king not that i think you did not love your father
    but that i know love is begun by time
    and that i see in passages of proof
    time qualifies the spark and fire of it
    there lives within the very flame of love
    a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
    and nothing is at a like goodness still
    for goodness growing to a plurisy
    dies in his own toomuch that we would do
    we should do when we would for this would changes
    and hath abatements and delays as many  
    as there are tongues are hands are accidents
    and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh
    that hurts by easing but to the quick o th ulcer
    hamlet comes back what would you undertake
    to show yourself your fathers son in deed
    more than in words
  laer to cut his throat i th church
  king no place indeed should murther sanctuarize
    revenge should have no bounds but good laertes
    will you do this keep close within your chamber
    will returnd shall know you are come home
    well put on those shall praise your excellence
    and set a double varnish on the fame
    the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
    and wager on your heads he being remiss
    most generous and free from all contriving
    will not peruse the foils so that with ease
    or with a little shuffling you may choose
    a sword unbated and in a pass of practice
    requite him for your father  
  laer i will dot
    and for that purpose ill anoint my sword
    i bought an unction of a mountebank
    so mortal that but dip a knife in it
    where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
    collected from all simples that have virtue
    under the moon can save the thing from death
    this is but scratchd withal ill touch my point
    with this contagion that if i gall him slightly
    it may be death
  king lets further think of this
    weigh what convenience both of time and means
    may fit us to our shape if this should fall
    and that our drift look through our bad performance
    twere better not assayd therefore this project
    should have a back or second that might hold
    if this did blast in proof soft let me see
    well make a solemn wager on your cunnings
    i hat
    when in your motion you are hot and dry  
    as make your bouts more violent to that end
    and that he calls for drink ill have prepard him
    a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
    if he by chance escape your venomd stuck
    our purpose may hold there but stay what noise

    that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
    there with fantastic garlands did she come
    of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples
    that liberal shepherds give a grosser name
    but our cold maids do dead mens fingers call them
    there on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    clambring to hang an envious sliver broke  
    when down her weedy trophies and herself
    fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide
    and mermaidlike awhile they bore her up
    which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes
    as one incapable of her own distress
    or like a creature native and indued
    unto that element but long it could not be
    till that her garments heavy with their drink
    pulld the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    to muddy death
  laer alas then she is drownd
  queen drownd drownd
  laer too much of water hast thou poor ophelia
    and therefore i forbid my tears but yet
    it is our trick nature her custom holds
    let shame say what it will when these are gone
    the woman will be out adieu my lord

    but that this folly douts it                          exit

    imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole
  hor twere to consider too curiously to consider so  
  ham no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty
    enough and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died
    alexander was buried alexander returneth into dust the dust is
    earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he
    was converted might they not stop a beer barrel
    imperious caesar dead and turnd to clay
    might stop a hole to keep the wind away
    o that that earth which kept the world in awe
    should patch a wall t expel the winters flaw
    but soft but soft aside here comes the king

    enter priests with a coffin in funeral procession king

    she should in ground unsanctified have lodgd
    till the last trumpet for charitable prayers
    shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
    yet here she is allowd her virgin crants
    her maiden strewments and the bringing home
    of bell and burial
  laer must there no more be done
  priest no more be done
    we should profane the service of the dead
    to sing a requiem and such rest to her
    as to peaceparted souls
  laer lay her i th earth
    and from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
    may violets spring i tell thee churlish priest

    i thought thy bridebed to have deckd sweet maid
    and not have strewd thy grave

    whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    deprivd thee of hold off the earth awhile
    till i have caught her once more in mine arms

    bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
    conjures the wandring stars and makes them stand

scene ii
elsinore a hall in the castle

enter hamlet and horatio

  ham so much for this sir now shall you see the other
    you do remember all the circumstance
  hor remember it my lord
  ham sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    that would not let me sleep methought i lay
    worse than the mutinies in the bilboes rashly
    and praisd be rashness for it let us know
    our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    when our deep plots do pall and that should learn us
    theres a divinity that shapes our ends
    roughhew them how we will
  hor that is most certain
  ham up from my cabin
    my seagown scarfd about me in the dark
    gropd i to find out them had my desire
    fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew
    to mine own room again making so bold  
    my fears forgetting manners to unseal
    their grand commission where i found horatio
    o royal knavery an exact command
    larded with many several sorts of reasons
    importing denmarks health and englands too
    with hoo such bugs and goblins in my life
    that on the supervise no leisure bated
    no not to stay the finding of the axe
    my head should be struck off
  hor ist possible
  ham heres the commission read it at more leisure
    but wilt thou bear me how i did proceed
  hor i beseech you
  ham being thus benetted round with villanies
    or i could make a prologue to my brains
    they had begun the play i sat me down
    devisd a new commission wrote it fair
    i once did hold it as our statists do
    a baseness to write fair and labourd much
    how to forget that learning but sir now  
    it did me yeomans service wilt thou know
    th effect of what i wrote
  hor ay good my lord
  ham an earnest conjuration from the king
    as england was his faithful tributary
    as love between them like the palm might flourish
    as peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    and stand a comma tween their amities
    and many suchlike ass of great charge
    that on the view and knowing of these contents
    without debatement further more or less
    he should the bearers put to sudden death
    not shriving time allowd
  hor how was this seald
  ham why even in that was heaven ordinant
    i had my fathers signet in my purse
    which was the model of that danish seal
    folded the writ up in the form of th other
    subscribd it gavet th impression placd it safely
    the changeling never known now the next day  
    was our seafight and what to this was sequent
    thou knowst already
  hor so guildenstern and rosencrantz go tot
  ham why man they did make love to this employment
    they are not near my conscience their defeat
    does by their own insinuation grow
    tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    between the pass and fell incensed points
    of mighty opposites
  hor why what a king is this
  ham does it not thinkst thee stand me now upon
    he that hath killd my king and whord my mother
    poppd in between th election and my hopes
    thrown out his angle for my proper life
    and with such coznage ist not perfect conscience
    to quit him with this arm and ist not to be damnd
    to let this canker of our nature come
    in further evil
  hor it must be shortly known to him from england
    what is the issue of the business there  
  ham it will be short the interim is mine
    and a mans life is no more than to say one
    but i am very sorry good horatio
    that to laertes i forgot myself
    for by the image of my cause i see
    the portraiture of his ill court his favours
    but sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    into a towring passion
  hor peace who comes here

                 enter young osric a courtier

  osr your lordship is right welcome back to denmark
  ham i humbly thank you sir aside to horatio dost know this
    waterfly
  hor aside to hamlet no my good lord
  ham aside to horatio thy state is the more gracious for tis a
    vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be
    lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the kings mess tis
    a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt  
  osr sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should impart
    a thing to you from his majesty
  ham i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit put your
    bonnet to his right use tis for the head
  osr i thank your lordship it is very hot
  ham no believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly
  osr it is indifferent cold my lord indeed
  ham but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion
  osr exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as twere i cannot
    tell how but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that
    he has laid a great wager on your head sir this is the matter
  ham i beseech you remember
                           hamlet moves him to put on his hat
  osr nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith sir here is
    newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman
    full of most excellent differences of very soft society and
    great showing indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card
    or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of
    what part a gentleman would see
  ham sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i  
    know to divide him inventorially would dozy th arithmetic of
    memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail
    but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great
    article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make
    true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else
    would trace him his umbrage nothing more
  osr your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
  ham the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
    rawer breath
  osr sir
  hor aside to hamlet ist not possible to understand in another
    tongue you will dot sir really
  ham what imports the nomination of this gentleman
  osr of laertes
  hor aside his purse is empty already alls golden words are
    spent
  ham of him sir
  osr i know you are not ignorant
  ham i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not
    much approve me well sir  
  osr you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is
  ham i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in
    excellence but to know a man well were to know himself
  osr i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him
    by them in his meed hes unfellowed
  ham whats his weapon
  osr rapier and dagger
  ham thats two of his weapons but well
  osr the king sir hath wagerd with him six barbary horses
    against the which he has impond as i take it six french
    rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and
    so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy
    very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of
    very liberal conceit
  ham what call you the carriages
  hor aside to hamlet i knew you must be edified by the margent
    ere you had done
  osr the carriages sir are the hangers
  ham the phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then  
    but on six barbary horses against six french swords their
    assigns and three liberalconceited carriages thats the french
    bet against the danish why is this all impond as you call it
  osr the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath
    laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer
  ham how if i answer no
  osr i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
  ham sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty
    it is the breathing time of day with me let the foils be
    brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose
    i will win for him if i can if not i will gain nothing but my
    shame and the odd hits
  osr shall i redeliver you een so
  ham to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
  osr i commend my duty to your lordship
  ham yours yours exit osric he does well to commend it
    himself there are no tongues else fors turn
  hor this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head  
  ham he did comply with his dug before he suckd it thus has he
    and many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes
    on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter
    a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and
    through the most fannd and winnowed opinions and do but blow
    them to their trialthe bubbles are out

                            enter a lord

  lord my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric who
    brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you will
    take longer time
  ham i am constant to my purposes they follow the kings pleasure
    if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided
    i be so able as now
  lord the king and queen and all are coming down
  ham in happy time
  lord the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    laertes before you fall to play  
  ham she well instructs me
                                                    exit lord
  hor you will lose this wager my lord
  ham i do not think so since he went into france i have been in
    continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not
    think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter
  hor nay good my lord 
  ham it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman
  hor if your mind dislike anything obey it i will forestall their
    repair hither and say you are not fit
  ham not a whit we defy augury theres a special providence in
    the fall of a sparrow if it be now tis not to come if it be
    not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come
    the readiness is all since no man knows aught of what he leaves
    what ist to leave betimes let be

    enter king queen laertes osric and lords with other
              attendants with foils and gauntlets
               a table and flagons of wine on it

    hamlet is of the faction that is wrongd
    his madness is poor hamlets enemy
    sir in this audience

    free me so far in your most generous thoughts  
    that i have shot my arrow oer the house
    and hurt my brother
  laer i am satisfied in nature
    whose motive in this case should stir me most
    to my revenge but in my terms of honour
    i stand aloof and will no reconcilement

    to keep my name ungord but till that time

                                                laertes falls
  laer it is here hamlet hamlet thou art slain
    no medicine in the world can do thee good
    in thee there is not half an hour of life
    the treacherous instrument is in thy hand
    unbated and envenomd the foul practice
    hath turnd itself on me lo here i lie
    never to rise again thy mothers poisond
    i can no more the king the kings to blame  
  ham the point envenomd too
    then venom to thy work                    hurts the king

  ham here thou incestuous murdrous damned dane

  laer he is justly servd

    exchange forgiveness with me noble hamlet
    mine and my fathers death come not upon thee
    nor thine on me                                       dies
  ham heaven make thee free of it i follow thee
    i am dead horatio wretched queen adieu
    you that look pale and tremble at this chance
    that are but mutes or audience to this act
    had i but time as this fell sergeant death
    is strict in his arrest o i could tell you
    but let it be horatio i am dead
    thou livst report me and my cause aright  
    to the unsatisfied
  hor never believe it
    i am more an antique roman than a dane
    heres yet some liquor left
  ham as thart a man
    give me the cup let go by heaven ill hat
    o good horatio what a wounded name
    things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
    if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
    absent thee from felicity awhile
    and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
    to tell my story         march afar off and shot within
    what warlike noise is this
  osr young fortinbras with conquest come from poland
    to the ambassadors of england gives
    this warlike volley
  ham o i die horatio
    the potent poison quite oercrows my spirit
    i cannot live to hear the news from england
    but i do prophesy th election lights  
    on fortinbras he has my dying voice
    so tell him with th occurrents more and less
    which have solicited the rest is silence             dies
  hor now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince
    and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
                                                 march within
    why does the drum come hither

    enter fortinbras and english ambassadors with drum
                  colours and attendants

  fort where is this sight
  hor what is it you will see
    if aught of woe or wonder cease your search
  fort this quarry cries on havoc o proud death
    what feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    that thou so many princes at a shot
    so bloodily hast struck
  ambassador the sight is dismal
    and our affairs from england come too late  
    the ears are senseless that should give us bearing
    to tell him his commandment is fulfilld
    that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
    where should we have our thanks
  hor not from his mouth
    had it th ability of life to thank you
    he never gave commandment for their death
    but since so jump upon this bloody question
    you from the polack wars and you from england
    are here arrivd give order that these bodies
    high on a stage be placed to the view
    and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    how these things came about so shall you hear
    of carnal bloody and unnatural acts
    of accidental judgments casual slaughters
    of deaths put on by cunning and forcd cause
    and in this upshot purposes mistook
    falln on th inventors heads all this can i
    truly deliver
  fort let us haste to hear it  
    and call the noblest to the audience
    for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune
    i have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
  hor of that i shall have also cause to speak
    and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
    but let this same be presently performd
    even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance
    on plots and errors happen
  fort let four captains
    bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage
    for he was likely had he been put on
    to have provd most royally and for his passage
    the soldiers music and the rites of war
    speak loudly for him
    take up the bodies such a sight as this
    becomes the field but here shows much amiss
    go bid the soldiers shoot
            exeunt marching after the which a peal of ordnance
                                                   are shot off  

the end
