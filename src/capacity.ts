/**
 * Calculates the space required to estimate the number of
 * distinct values in a set with a given accuracy and confidence.
 *
 * @param n - The total number of values in the set, or an estimate if unknown.
 *
 * - Should be a positive integer.
 * - If estimated, an overestimate will generally give better results but require more space.
 *
 * @param epsilon - The relative error of the estimation. Controls accuracy.
 *
 * - Should be between 0 and 1.
 * - Smaller values result in more accuraacy but require more space.
 * - Defaults to `0.05` (i.e. 95% accurate, meaning estimates are within a Â±5% range of the true value).
 *
 * @param delta - The probability of the estimate falling outside the accuracy range. Controls confidence.
 *
 * - Should be between 0 and 1.
 * - Smaller values result in higher confidence but require more space.
 * - Defaults to `0.01` (i.e. 99% confidence, meaning a 99% probability the estimate is within the accuracy range).
 *
 * @returns The calculated capacity.
